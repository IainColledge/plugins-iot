# plugins-iot

Scripts that output Nagios format data (0,1,2,3 exit codes and performance data). Can be used in any monitoring system that supports Nagios plugins.

Suggested plugin naming standard is sensorname.something_human_understandable

Ideally the plugins would be Python so we can bundle up the dependencies at some point

Pull requests welcome!
